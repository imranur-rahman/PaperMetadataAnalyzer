Based on the titles extracted from major software engineering conferences and journals, several patterns in writing paper titles can be identified. Here are a few common patterns:

Descriptive, Process-Oriented Titles: Titles that focus on methods, processes, or approaches. For example:
- "Automating Dependency Updates in Practice: An Exploratory Study on GitHub Dependabot" .
- "Towards Developer-Centered Automatic Program Repair: Findings from Bloomberg" .
Exploratory or Comparative Studies: These titles often indicate an investigation into existing issues or comparative studies. For example:
- "An Empirical Study of Log Analysis at Microsoft" .
- "A Comprehensive Study on Quality Assurance Tools for Java" .
Tool or Framework Development: Titles related to the creation of new tools, frameworks, or methodologies. For example:
- "iTiger: An Automatic Issue Title Generation Tool" .
- "PolyFax: A Toolkit for Characterizing Multi-Language Software" .
Problem-Solution or Cause-Effect Pairs: Titles often state a problem followed by a proposed solution or investigation into the problem. For example:
- "Discovering Reusable Functional Features in Legacy Object-Oriented Systems" .
- "Exploring and Evaluating Personalized Models for Code Generation" .
Application-Based Titles: Titles that apply a specific technique to solve real-world problems. For example:
- "Optimizing Highly-Parallel Simulation-Based Verification of Cyber-Physical Systems" .
- "Automating Question Title Reformulation by Mining Modification Logs from Stack Overflow" .
These patterns reflect trends in the types of topics addressed in the software engineering field, ranging from methodological research to practical tool development and applied case studies.
